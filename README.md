Kustom is a very powerful app on Android OS. You can create or design widget wallpaper by following your imagination. With all due respect, Kustom is not straightforward. There are many known limits and known Issues that newbie should know before designing any complex preset.

## Understand the GUI

- Available spaces are a list of your Kustom widgets on the home screen. (Why not rename it to Widget Lists ?!!?)

- Widget that never exports and reload presets will be named with some sequence number.

- You can't rename the widget name directly. To change a widget name, you have to export the widget to a new preset and reload that preset over your current widget again.

- No browse button when export preset. Manual typing is only your choice. Be careful, no overwritten warning popup dialog. It's good to export new names and reload the present of every widget. It will remember the export info. But sometimes it shows the other widget info.

- Invalid Width when using Text boxâ€™s Type property as Fit Width. Width is smaller than usual.
